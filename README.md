## Description
The Employee Profile Generator is a node.js CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The application uses the inquirer npm package to create this CLI tool, receives user input, and easily generates an employee card. The application initially asks the user for their employee type, giving an option between Manager, Engineer, or Intern. Depending on their response, they are prompted to answer a series of questions. Using the answers provided, an employee card is generated and displayed in an HTML page.
